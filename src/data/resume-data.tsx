  about:
    "Versatile Full Stack Engineer eager to learn and improve.",
  summary:
    "Before programming, I've been a high school teacher, I conducted scientific research, I was accepted in a prestigious jewelry school in Paris, I've been a medical secretary, I unrolled toilet paper to make ends meet. These experiences taught me how to search for information, how to synthesize it, to communicate it, teamwork and self-questioning. As a developper, I mostly worked with TypeScript, Angular, Java and Spring, but I'm always interested in learning new technologies.",
